    <p>
        The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film[5][6] written and directed by the Wachowskis.[a] It is the
        first installment in The Matrix film series, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo
        Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a
        simulated reality, the Matrix, which intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their
        bodies as an energy source.[7] When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias "Neo", uncovers
        the truth, he joins a rebellion against the machines along with other people who have been freed from the
        Matrix.
